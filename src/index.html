    <h3>About Me and Honesty Statement</h3>
    <p>
      I've wanted to become a programmer for a very long time! It is alot harder than i expected, because i see many
      self taught developers online, saying that more people should do it, but they dont really explain what courses
      they took, and they may not have a very wide variety of programming skills.

      I used to be an electrician apprentice, an it wasnt what i expected, because i thought they did more than work
      in contruction. Like electricains that work in a lab would be very cool, but thats a completley different trade.
